## we have two types of machine learning : the supervised learning and the unsupervised one
## supervised we give the input and the output when training the model
## unsupervised we just give the input data

### Supervised learning : Classification (categorical variable) and Regression (quantitative variable) 
#### Classification : KNN algorithm
